## About the Book
The book is all about the basics of NLP, generative AI, and their specific component LLM. In this book, we have provided conceptual knowledge about different terminologies and concepts of NLP and NLG with practical hands-on. 

This comprehensive book offers a deep dive into the world of NLP and LLMs. Starting with the fundamentals of Python programming and code editors, the book gradually introduces NLP concepts, including text preprocessing, word embeddings, and transformer architectures. You will explore the architecture and capabilities of popular models like GPT-3 and BERT. The book also covers practical aspects of LLM usage for RAG applications using frameworks like LangChain and Hugging Face and deploying them in real world applications. With a focus on both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, this book is ideal for anyone looking to master the art of NLP and LLMs. The book also contains AWS Cloud deployment, which will help readers step into the world of cloud computing.

As the book contains both theoretical and practical approaches, it will help the readers to gain confidence in the deployment of LLMs for any use cases, as well as get acquainted with the required generative AI knowledge to crack the interviews.
